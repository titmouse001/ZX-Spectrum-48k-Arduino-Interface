# ZX-Spectrum-48k-Arduino-Interface
This project aims to load .SNA files into the 48k ZX Spectrum using a low-cost hardware interface built around an Arduino. The interface features an SD card slot (hidden at the back) for loading .SNA snapshots directly from the card. An OLED display provides basic status information, while the game list is shown on the ZX Spectrum's screen. It also includes a port for a Kempston joystick.
