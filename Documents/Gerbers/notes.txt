Versions prior to v2.00 are no longer supported by the software.
Some changes have been made to the Arduino software, which means PCBs earlier
than v2.00 will no longer work correctly.
Versions starting from v2.xx now use a latch to read from the I/O. 

WHY THE CHANGE TO LATCHED "OUT" DATA (Z80->Arduino)
---------------------------------------------------
Previously, a "HALT Fudge 1BIT Protocol" was used. Kind of hacky, but I’m proud it even worked! It relied 
on a timing scheme using HALT-triggered NMI pulses to clock out data, it nailed the sync between the Z80
and the Arduino, and was extremely reliable! However it was just a bit too slow for sending larger
data amounts like a screenshot to the Arduino. 
So the circuit design now uses a 74HC574 to Latch (rising edge) the I/O data bus, reading a 8 bits of I/O data
and storing it for the Arduino to read.  Big improvement over the older HALT pulse timing trick, since the latch
now captures a whole byte of data and hands it to the Arduino.
