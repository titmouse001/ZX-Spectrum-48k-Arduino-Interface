<h3>What is Image to ZX Spectrum?</h3>
<p>Image to ZX Spec(trum) is a utility to convert image and video files to a REAL ZX Spectrum as a slideshow/video, to a Spectrum compatible file format for games development (SCREEN$ &quot;scr&quot; format) or create retro art posters (images of any size - memory limited - can have a Spectrum effect applied to them). It also allows you to display images on a standard 128K machine in new screen modes that weren't available during the machine's heyday (such as 102 colours high resolution).</p>
<h3>Installation/Usage</h3>
<p>If you have Java installed just double click the Img2ZXSpec.jar file (like you would a regular .exe file). If you don't have Java you need to get it first - <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava">http://www.java.com/getjava</a> The easiest way to learn how to use Image to Zx Spec is just to play with it, you can even change most image options during image conversion. For information on advanced features read on...</p>
<h3>General Options Tab</h3>
<p>Open the control panel &quot;Options - Control&quot; panel or click the gear icon.</p>
<h4>Image Export (.png/.jpg)</h4>
<p>This is the file format to be used for regular (PC) image export. PNG has one benefit over JPEG format in that it does not suffer image degradation so it has been chosen as the default image format. Enabling the 256x192 resize option will force all images to be reduced to this size, otherwise images can be as large as memory allows.</p>
<h4>Tape/Slideshow/Video Loader</h4>
<p>This is the ZX Spectrum software to load your converted images that are saved in the .tap (tape) output file. Typically the &quot;Simple&quot; option will suffice for Spectrum emulators and individual images. Buffered USR0 provides a better solution for a real Spectrum and requires at least a 128K model to use, but removes attribute flicker commonly seen during video playback. GigaScreen USR 0 is also 128K only but is intended specifically to view the GigaScreen 102 colour images and is not compatible with video or regular Spectrum images. WARNING: GigaScreen images displayed with this loader flicker <em>a lot</em> and the image display quality is poor owing to flashing two images quickly using BASIC. A hardware or machine code viewer will display GigaScreen SCR images more accurately and with a lot less flicker (e.g. the built in viewer in Fatware).</p>
<p>All built-in loaders allow you to specify the frame delay between images showing before the video/slideshow starts on the Spectrum. Alternatively you can add  your own custom loader by choosing the &quot;Custom&quot; droplist option. See the FAQ note for more information on video support.</p>
<h4>Showing the Frames Per Second (FPS)</h4>
<p>Enabling this will show on the work in progress preview the current rate at which images are being converted in real time. The calculation is worked out by taking an average every 2 seconds as to how much new completed work has been added to the work result queue. This option adds virtually no CPU overhead and is useful for determining the best Threads per CPU value to use.</p>
<h4>Showing the Work In Progress (WIP) Preview</h4>
<p>This enables the preview of images being converted AND the FPS counter if it too is enabled. Disabling this option may provide a small improvement to the conversion performance.</p>
<h4>Output Options</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SCR (.scr/screen) This is the file format representing a snapshot of a real Spectrum's graphics memory area. This is not much use without a special file viewer. Images using this format will automatically be resized to 256x192 pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TAP (.tap/tape file) This is for the real enthusiasts. Using this option will convert your images to a slideshow, prepared as a &quot;.tap&quot; file suitable for emulators or with conversion to audio or DivIDE, real Spectrum hardware. On loading you will be presented with a prompt informing you that it is the Image to ZX Spec program and that you can choose the delay between images (or frames in the case of video) for the slideshow. Images using this format will automatically be resized to 256x192 pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text Export (.txt file) This is used to store the raw UTF-8 text data of any Character Converter dithered images. In the case of a converted video this file contains many frames appended after each other. Note that the Character Converter can also have output exported as regular images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anim Gif Export (.gif file) This is the most convenient way of viewing converted videos on a PC and produces a looping slideshow/animation of the chosen images or video file. Images using this format will automatically be resized to 256x192 pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anim Gif Frame Delay (millisecs) This is the delay between changing images/frames of the Anim Gif Export. As a general rule of thumb if you are converting video set the value to 1000 รท &quot;Video Sampling Rate&quot; option found on the pre-processing tab, e.g. if the video sample rate is 10 then the anim gif frame delay should be 100.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pre-Process Options Tab</h3>
<p>These are basic options to allow you to improve the source image or video before conversion to a Spectrum format. These options affect images in memory only and do not change your source files.</p>
<h4>Scaling</h4>
<p>Scales the source image to the Spectrum's native resolution, with options to keep the image proportional. Selecting &quot;None&quot; will create a &quot;Spectrumified&quot; image but it is not compatible with a real Spectrum - use png/jpeg export output to view images converted with this option. The 256x384 (Gigascreen Interlaced) requires that the Gigascreen Palette colour mode is enabled and will not allow the <a href="#colour-mode">Colour Mode</a> dropdown to be changed whilst it is selected.</p>
<h4>Video Sampling Rate</h4>
<p>Converting video to a Spectrum requires some skill balancing the frame rate so that playback speed is correct. Changing this value increases or reduces the number of frames per second played back by the spectrum. Specify too large an amount and a humble (real) Spectrum cannot keep up, too low an amount causes the video to look (even more) jerky. This value closely ties in with the frame delay value you must use with the video loader software on the Spectrum. In an ideal world for 10 FPS video you would specify 10 as the &quot;video sampling rate&quot; and 5 for the &quot;frame delay&quot; in the Spectrum video loader. The value 5 is determined because a PAL Spectrum has 50 screen refreshes per second and 50/10 = 5. Unfortunately real hardware often can't keep up - see the FAQ for recommended values instead.</p>
<h4>Saturation Change</h4>
<p>Alters the image saturation</p>
<h4>Contrast Change</h4>
<p>Alters the image contrast</p>
<h4>Brightness Change</h4>
<p>Alters the image brightness</p>
<h3>Dither Options Tab</h3>
<h4>Dithering Mode</h4>
<p>These are the error diffusion dithering &quot;patterns&quot; of dots you can see when an image is converted. There are a number of different patterns (algorithms) to choose from and all have different benefits. In general, the &quot;Low Error Atkinson&quot; (or &quot;Atkinson&quot;) and &quot;Magic Square 4x4 (Nasik)&quot; tend to be the best monochrome and colour modes respectively, although you may need to enable some pre-processing options such as contrast change to get the best results especially for the non Ordered/Magic dithers. The character converter dither attempts to map the graphics to the ZX spectrum character set and tends to work best with pictures that are not &quot;busy&quot; and have high contrast. To see a preview of all dithering modes choose &quot;View Dither Options&quot; from the Options tool bar drop list. Note that if you are converting video then the preview will show a random frame from the first few seconds.</p>
<h4>Colour Mode</h4>
<p>Choose whether to have two colour dithered images &quot;Monochrome&quot;, &quot;Full Palette&quot; for the full Spectrum palette or &quot;GigaScreen&quot; which uses persistence of vision to generate 102 colours. GigaScreen works on a real Spectrum by flashing two specially created images in sequence, the &quot;blur&quot; (persistence of vision) produces the extra colours. The file representation a Spectrum &quot;scr&quot; file is is two regular scr images saved as one file. As a jpg or png file these are represented as the actual colours. FatWare DivIDE firmware has the the capability to display these images on a real Spectrum, if you don't have that, there is a GigaScreen loader included (see General Options, Tape/Slideshow/Video Loader above) but this is not  recommended as it is a very poor and flickery solution. Monochrome mode tends to make detail much easier to see but with the obvious colour sacrifice. Monochrome conversion tends to be at least 3 times faster than colour mode conversion.</p>
<h4>Attribute Choice</h4>
<p>A technical limitation of the ZX Spectrum was that it only had 15 colours (16 if you count black twice). These colours were divided into two sets which where generated by taking 8 initial colours with full brightness and halving the voltage, producing another 7 (8) colours. Converted image colours can only be in one of these two sets. When the converter detects that pixels being analysed are in both sets it decides based on the favouritism mode which set it should use for the final result. The favouritism modes are Half Brightness, Full Brightness or Most Popular Colour, the latter mode determines the set for the whole 8x8 pixel attribute block by finding which set the most popular (frequently occurring) colour is in. The half and full modes determine that if an analysed attribute block has both half or bright set colours then favour the user selected colour set. Finally, the &quot;force&quot; modes force all colours to either be in the half or full brightness set regardless, depending on which force option is chosen. A special &quot;Reduced Colour Set&quot; is also available which omits the magenta and turquoise colours of the Spectrum palette but is otherwise identical to the &quot;Force Half Brightness&quot; option.</p>
<h4>GigaScreen Attribute Choice</h4>
<p>GigaScreen images use two regular ZX Spectrum images (screens). This option allows you to determine which colour brightness set (as regular attribute choice) is used on each screen. Choosing &quot;One screen bright, One screen half bright&quot; is not recommended as the conversion calculations involved are slower and the &quot;GigaScreen SCR Export Attribute Order&quot; option (see Advanced Options) cannot be used due to technical limitations.</p>
<h4>Monochrome INK Colour</h4>
<p>Option to choose one of the two colours when the Monochrome option in Colour Modes (see above) is used. This is the Spectrum &quot;INK&quot; colour</p>
<h4>Monochrome PAPER Colour</h4>
<p>Option to choose the second colour when the Monochrome option in Colour Modes (see above) is used. This is the Spectrum &quot;PAPER&quot; colour.</p>
<h4>Threshold (Monochrome only)</h4>
<p>This determines the degree to which colours in the picture should be considered as black for the purposes of the Monochrome colour mode. The lower the value, the less colours are black (or whatever ink colour is chosen) and vice versa. This setting can also be used by the Character Converter dither mode.</p>
<h3>Advanced Options</h3>
<h4>Serpentine Error Diffusion</h4>
<p>This mode causes any error diffusion dither algorithms to switch directions on each consecutive pixel line, as opposed to &quot;book&quot; style reading of the pixels which reads only left to right. The result is that some dithers may produce better results with less perceivable dithering patterns in the final image.</p>
<h4>Constrain Error Diffusion To Attribute</h4>
<p>The nature of error diffusion is to spread &quot;error&quot; trying to get find an exact Spectrum colour match for a single pixel to surrounding pixels. The Spectrum palette is problematic in that colours can only be changed on each 8x8 pixel attribute block, spreading an error outside of this block may cause a cascading effect and create even worse results in the next block. This option prevents the error exceeding 8x8 pixels at the expense of a grid pattern appearing across the image, but often this may be preferable to an image where a number of attribute blocks have visibly wrong colours.</p>
<h4>GigaScreen SCR Export Attribute Order</h4>
<p>This option only affects the SCR and Tape GigaScreen export and output (see General Options, SCR Export) and allows you to determine which screen order certain colours are in; e.g. a pink may be made up of white in screen 1, red in screen 2. The option is intended to reduce artifacts and flicker when alternating screens. You can choose to order in a number of ways but &quot;Luminosity&quot; is generally the best, &quot;None&quot; is fast and &quot;Intelligent&quot; attempts to group colours. Additionally &quot;Brightness&quot; may reduce flicker, &quot;Contrast&quot; and &quot;Hue&quot; may reduce may help reduce attribute artifact edges.</p>
<h4>Colour Distance Algorithm</h4>
<p>When making a decision on which Spectrum colours best match those of the source image's pixels a colour space &quot;distance&quot; is evaluated. The choice of algorithm for this evaluation is configured here - typically the Compuphase algorithm is the best and uses heuristics based on human vision, the classic Image to ZX Spec algorithm next (which is just a simple sum of RGB space distances), followed by the Euclidean which is the straight line distance in RGB space. You may find any one of these better suits your use case, typically the latter two are interchangeable however classic tends to occasionally favour darker colours which can lead to better results.</p>
<h4>Video Import Engine</h4>
<p>By default Image to ZX Spec's uses HumbleVideo which is fast platform native video decoder. However, in case your video format is not supported you can use VLCJ that uses the VLC application instead. Selecting this option will prompt you to locate the VLC folder on your computer. Note that if you are using 64 bit Java you need to use the 64 bit version of VLC - this is not the default download version of VLC. VLC is resource heavy and writes its output files to temporary disk space, it is recommended you use this option with caution.</p>
<h4>Turbo Mode</h4>
<p>In simple terms the processing is devoted to video processing when it is switched on, resulting in a stuttering real time preview. When it is switched off - the recommended setting - more processing is devoted to the real time preview.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>My video won't convert!</h4>
<p>By default Humble Video is used to decode videos. In some cases it may not be compatible with your video's encoding, you can instead use the slower VLC plugin. Under the Advanced Options tab choose VLC from the Video Import Engine drop down instead of Humble Video and select the directory location of your machine's VLC install. Note you need to be using a version of VLC 3 or later and which matches your machine architecture (i.e. 32 or 64 bit).</p>
<h4>What frame rate should the video be converted at?</h4>
<p>This rate may vary depending on how you are using the video - using the video player in an emulator, the Basic Spectrum Video Loader's &quot;Frame Delay&quot; should typically be between 5 (exact) and 10 for 100% speed emulation using a &quot;Video Sampling Rate&quot; of 10 FPS. On real hardware it has been determined for a 100% correct playback speed a frame rate of <em>7.14</em> FPS for the &quot;Video Sampling Rate&quot; and a value of <em>1</em> for the Spectrum Video Loader's &quot;Frame Delay&quot; is <em>usually</em> needed. This was tested using a Spectrum +3, a DivIDE Plus to play the video back from, and the Buffered USR 0 (128K) player.</p>
<h4>How do I write a custom loader?</h4>
<p>The loaders can be written in Spectrum BASIC and typically converted by one of the many .bas to .tap converters available on World of Spectrum. See the Image to ZX Spec source code &quot;simple.bas&quot; text file for an example. More advanced users may wish to write a loader in assembly/machine code for display of GigaScreen images or to provide enhanced features.</p>
